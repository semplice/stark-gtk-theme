Alternatively, you can clone the latest version its git repository:

###Using the Source

There are scripts to simplify the rendering process;to run them (and edit icons) you will need:

 * inkscape
 * python3

To render new assets from their source SVG files, run the following:

    ./scripts/render-*-gtk3-assets.py
    ./scripts/render-*-gtk3-assets-hidpi.py
    ./scripts/render-*-metacity-assets.py
    ./scripts/render-*-unity-assets.py

If it's throwing an error, the script may not be executable, try:
	
	chmod +x *

This script will look in the source directories (../src/*) and render the respective icons (provided there are changes).
